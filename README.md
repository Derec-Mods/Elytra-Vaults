# Elytra Vaults Datapack + Plugin for Minecraft Java Edition
Make sure to install the Datapack Version that correctly matches your Minecraft Version or issues may arise.

## About
This Datapack aims to remove the tedious grind to go out and find an End City and hope to find an Elytra that hasn’t been taken yet. With this Datapack, each player visiting and End Ship gets an Elytra without the disappointment that someone already came and raided it.


## Features
Upon generating either a new world/new chunks in your Minecraft world End City Ships will now spawn with a Vault Block instead of the usual Item Frame + Elytra.

When approaching the Elytra Vault you will notice a Text Display entity above the Vault informing unfamiliar players that the Vault requires 1 Shulker Shell in order to open the Vault. This had to be done in order to make the Vault function.

⚠️ **Please keep in mind that the required Vault Key may be changed in a future update, so be sure to keep an eye on the changelog when updating.** ⚠️


## Installation
Be sure to install this Datapack to the right location or it will not work properly. 

The *correct* file path is **saves/[world]/datapacks** 

## Extra Information
I now have a Ko-fi link located on the pack’s Modrinth page on the sidebar, but always remember donations are appreciated, but **never** required.

## Issues
Please report any issues to the Discord located in the Links tab, or on the Planet Minecraft page.
